- AI calls go through server functions in src/lib/ai.functions.ts using the streaming helper in src/lib/ai.server.ts — keeps the key server-side and avoids buffered timeouts.
- User data (tasks, history, favorites, settings) lives in the browser store in src/lib/store.ts until accounts are added — no backend yet.
- Tools hand off content via a `prefill` search param — keeps the cross-tool connections simple and linkable.
